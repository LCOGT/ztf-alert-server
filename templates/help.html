		<h2>MARS Help</h2>
		<p>
			Welcome to MARS, which aims to Make Alerts Really Simple. MARS provides a browser and API based interface to the
			public ZTF alert stream and an archive of all previously released public alerts.
		</p>

		<p>
			MARS allows users to inspect alerts over any period of time and to apply filters
			on alerts that restrict the alerts shown to a subset that is of interest for any science
			case. Selected alerts can then be downloaded in their entireties.
		</p>

		<h3>Using the MARS web interface</h3>

		<p>
			The main page of the MARS interface consists of a list of selection criteria and a table of alerts. By default the
			table lists the 100 most recent public alerts from ZTF with no filters applied. To narrow down the results shown,
			use the filters on the left.
		</p>

		<p>
			To apply filters simply enter the desired value into each corresponding field on the filter list and click
			"select". Some fields are range selections, some upper or lower bounds, and some are simple matches. For example,
			to show alerts with a Real/Bogus score greater or equal to 0.8, you would place "0.8" in the field marked "rb &gt;="
			and click "select".
		</p>

		<h3>Viewing details of a single alert</h3>

		<p>
			Clicking on the id of an alert in the main table will bring you to that alertâ€™s detail page. Here you can download
			the original .avro file, view the detection triplet, lightcurve, and the data provided by the avro.
		</p>

		<p>
			The three cutouts are taken from the .avro file and display the 1x1 arcmin area surrounding the alert.
			They are displayed using JS9, which is a web based version of DS9. You can access the menu of JS9 functions
			(such as scaling and analysis) by clicking "toggle JS9 menus".
		</p>

		<h3>Using the JSON API</h3>

		<p>
			JSON (Javascript Object Notation) is a widely used data serialization format. Most programming languages provide
			functions for reading and writing it, which makes it ideal for use in web services. Both the table and detail view
			can be viewed in JSON form by adding the URL parameter ?format=json. For example, to view the JSON list of alerts
			with a Real/Bogus score >= 0.8, you would use the following url:
		</p>

		<p><a href="https://mars.lco.global/?rb__gte=0.8&format=json">https://mars.lco.global/?rb__gte=0.8&format=json</a></p>

		<p>
      Alerts will be located within the <code>results</code> key. The other parameters, <code>has_next</code>,
      <code>has_prev</code>, <code>pages</code> and <code>total</code> are informative keys that should help you
      paginate through results should your query return greater than 100 alerts.
		</p>

		<p>
			Similarly, a single alert can also be viewed in JSON form:
		</p>

		<p><a href="https://mars.lco.global/4157148/?format=json">https://mars.lco.global/4157148/?format=json</a></p>

		<p>
      The id part of the URL comes from the "lco_id" key contained in the alert JSON.
    </p>

    <h3>Column Descriptions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>id</strong>: Unique ID for this alert, assigned by LCO. lco_id in json view.</li>
			<li><strong>objectId</strong>: Unique identifier for this object.</li>
			<li><strong>jd</strong>: Observation Julian date at start of exposure [days]</li>
			<li><strong>filter</strong>: (derived) Filter name (g, r, i) derived from <strong>fid</strong> (1, 2, 3).</li>
			<li><strong>ra</strong>: Right Ascension of candidate; J2000 [deg]</li>
			<li><strong>dec</strong>: Declination of candidate; J2000 [deg]</li>
			<li><strong>magpsf</strong>: Magnitude from PSF-fit photometry measured from difference image [mag]</li>
			<li><strong>magap</strong>: Aperture mag using 8 pixel diameter aperture measured from difference image [mag]</li>
			<li><strong>distnr</strong>: Distance to nearest source in reference image PSF-catalog within 30 arcsec (1 pixel = 1.0 arcsecond) [pixels]</li>
			<li><strong>deltamaglatest</strong>: (Derived) magpsf[this alert] - magpsf[last alert at this location from image of same filter] if a previous alert is available, otherwise Null.</li>
			<li><strong>deltamagref</strong>: (Derived) If distnr &lt; 2" (~2 ZTF pixels), deltamagref = (magnr - magpsf), otherwise Null.</li>
			<li><strong>rb</strong>: RealBogus quality score; range is 0 to 1 where closer to 1 is more reliable.</li>
			<li><strong>classtar</strong>: Star/Galaxy classification score from SExtractor measured from the difference image.</li>
		</ul>
    <h3>Filter descriptions</h3>
    <p>
      Most filters correspond to columns displayed in the main table, with the exception of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>candid</strong>: The value of the candid field of the alert. Exact match.</li>
      <li><strong>Cone Search</strong>: Returns results contained within the radius of a given point, in degrees. For example: 43.2,-30.2,0.2</li>
      <li><strong>Nearby Objects</strong>: Each alert contains the names of the 3 closest objects from the Panstarrs-1 catalog. Filtering on a PS1 object id will return alerts for which this object is listed as close by.</li>
      <li><strong>Classtar</strong>: Return alerts where the The Star/Galaxy classification score from SExtractor is within the provided bounds.</li>
      <li><strong>Fwhm</strong>: Return alerts where the FWHM is less than or equal to the given value.</li>
    </ul>
